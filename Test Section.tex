\section{Design}
The implementation of semiconductor photocathodes presented unique challenges compared to typical UED systems. The first is that it must be maintained in ultra high vacuum at all times. Semiconductor cathodes are grown in UHV via molecular beam epitaxy, then transported to it's destination accelerator via vacuum suitcase, which is a smaller transportable vacuum chamber. The
